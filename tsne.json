While in the long-term they are very useful to developers, many modern APIs have an incredibly steep learning curve, due to their hundreds of functions handling many arguments, obscure documentation, and frequently changing semantics. For APIs that perform data transformations, novices can often provide an I/O example demonstrating the desired transformation, but may be stuck on how to translate it to the API. A programming-by-example synthesis engine that takes such I/O examples and directly produces programs in the target API could help such novices. Such an engine presents unique challenges due to the breadth of real-world APIs, and the often-complex constraints over function arguments. We present a generator-based synthesis approach to contend with these problems. This approach uses a program candidate generator, which encodes basic constraints on the space of programs. We introduce neural-backed operators which can be seamlessly integrated into the program generator. To improve the efficiency of the search, we simply use these operators at non-deterministic decision points, instead of relying on domain-specific heuristics.

We provide a novel definition of contextual flow for this IR, leveraging both the underlying data- and control-flow of the program. We then analyze the embeddings qualitatively using analogies and clustering, and evaluate the learned representation on three different high-level tasks.

Such approaches reduce the burden of the analysis designers, but they do not remove it completely; they still leave the highly nontrivial task of designing so called features to the hands of the designers. Our technique automates this feature design process. The idea is to use programs as features after reducing and abstracting them. Our technique goes through selected program-query pairs in codebases, and it reduces and abstracts the program in each pair to a few lines of code, while ensuring that the analysis behaves similarly for the original and the new programs with respect to the query. Each reduced program serves as a boolean feature for program-query pairs. This feature evaluates to true for a given program-query pair when (as a program) it is included in the program part of the pair. We have implemented our approach for three real-world program analyses. Our experimental evaluation shows that these analyses with automatically-generated features perform comparably to those with manually crafted features.</p>\n", "tags": ["representation"], "tsne_embedding": [5.493015766143799, 4.909361362457275]}, {"key": "chakraborty2018tree2tree", "year": "2018", "title": "CODIT: Code Editing with Tree-Based Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "<p>The way developers edit day-to-day code tends to be repetitive, often using existing code elements.

Conventional decompilers have the following major limitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language pair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii) their output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct functionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture the semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret.

The main insight of our method is to constrain the predictions from the learning procedure to respect the logical constraints, which we achieve by relaxing the logical inference problem of type prediction into a continuous optimisation problem. To evaluate the idea, we built a tool called OptTyper to predict a TypeScript declaration file for a JavaScript library. OptTyper combines a continuous interpretation of logical constraints derived by a simple program transformation and static analysis of the JavaScript code, with natural constraints obtained from a deep learning model, which learns naming conventions for types from a large codebase. We evaluate OptTyper on a data set of 5,800 open-source JavaScript projects that have type annotations in the well-known DefinitelyTyped repository.

Gradient-guided optimization presents a promising alternative to evolutionary guidance. Gradient-guided techniques have been shown to significantly outperform evolutionary algorithms at solving high-dimensional structured optimization problems in domains like machine learning by efficiently utilizing gradients or higher-order derivatives of the underlying function.
