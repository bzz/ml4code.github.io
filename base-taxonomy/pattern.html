structure within code. These models are an instantiation of clustering
in the code domain; they can find reusable and human-interpretable patterns.

          <td><p>We present the first method for automatically mining code idioms from a corpus of previously written, idiomatic software projects. We take the view that a code idiom is a syntactic fragment that recurs across projects and has a single semantic purpose. Idioms may have metavariables, such as the body of a for loop. Modern IDEs commonly provide facilities for manually defining idioms and inserting them on demand, but this does not help programmers to write idiomatic code in languages or using libraries with which they are unfamiliar. We present Haggis, a system for mining code idioms that builds on recent advanced techniques from statistical natural language processing, namely, nonparametric Bayesian probabilistic tree substitution grammars. We apply Haggis to several of the most popular open source projects from GitHub. We present a wide range of evidence that the resulting idioms are semantically meaningful, demonstrating that they do indeed recur across software projects and that they occur more frequently in illustrative code examples collected from a Q&amp;A site. Manual examination of the most common idioms indicate that they describe important program concepts, including object creation, exception handling, and resource management.</p>

          <td><p>During maintenance, developers spend a lot of time transforming existing code: refactoring, optimizing, and adding checks to make it more robust. Much of this work is the drudgery of identifying and replacing specific patterns, yet it resists automation, because of meaningful patterns are hard to automatically find. We present a technique for mining loop idioms, surprisingly probable semantic patterns that occur in loops, from big code to find meaningful patterns. First, we show that automatically identifiable patterns exist, in great numbers, with a large scale empirical study of loop over 25 MLOC. We find that loops in this corpus are simple and predictable: 90% of them have fewer than 15LOC and 90% have no nesting and very simple control structure. Encouraged by this result, we coil loops to abstract away syntactic diversity to define information rich loop idioms. We show that only 50 loop idioms cover 50% of the concrete loops. We show how loop idioms can help a tool developers identify and prioritize refactorings. We also show how our framework opens the door to data-driven tool and language design discovering opportunities to introduce new API calls and language constructs: loop idioms show that LINQ would benefit from an Enumerate operator, a result confirmed by the fact that precisely this feature is one of the most requested features on StackOverflow with 197 votes and 95k views.</p>

To address this, we present PAM (Probabilistic API Miner), a near parameter-free probabilistic algorithm for mining the most interesting API call patterns. We show that PAM significantly outperforms both MAPO and UPMiner, achieving 69% test-set precision, at retrieving relevant API call sequences from GitHub. Moreover, we focus on libraries for which the developers have explicitly provided code examples, yielding over 300,000 LOC of hand-written API example code from the 967 client projects in the data set. This evaluation suggests that the hand-written examples actually have limited coverage of real API usages.</p>

          <td><p>Developers spend much of their time reading and browsing source code, raising new opportunities for summarization methods. Indeed, modern code editors provide code folding, which allows one to selectively hide blocks of code. However this is impractical to use as folding decisions must be made manually or based on simple rules. We introduce the
autofolding problem, which is to automatically create a code summary by folding less informative code regions. We present a novel solution by formulating the problem as a sequence of AST folding decisions, leveraging a scoped topic model for code tokens. On an annotated set of popular open source projects, we show that our summarizer outperforms simpler baselines, yielding a 28% error reduction. Furthermore, we find through a case study that our summarizer is strongly preferred by experienced developers. More broadly, we hope this work will aid program comprehension by turning code folding into a usable and valuable tool.</p>

to the system, which defines the data to

them. The system then extracts facts that
match the predefined ontology. We propose an unsupervised model that jointly
learns a latent ontological structure of an
input corpus, and identifies facts from the
corpus that match the learned structure.
Our approach combines mixed membership stochastic block models and topic
models to infer a structure by jointly modeling text, a latent concept hierarchy, and
latent semantic relationships among the
entities mentioned in the text. As a case
study, we apply the model to a corpus
of Web documents from the software domain, and evaluate the accuracy of the various components of the learned ontology.</p>

          <td>Sketch Mining</td>
          <td><p>We present a Bayesian statistical approach to the problem of automatic program synthesis. Our synthesizer starts
by learning, offline and from an existing corpus, a probabilistic model of real-world programs. During synthesis,
it is provided some ambiguous and incomplete evidence about the nature of the programming task that the user
wants automated, for example sets of API calls or data types that are relevant for the task. Given this input, the
synthesizer infers a posterior distribution over type-safe programs that assigns higher likelihood to programs
that, according to the learned model, are more likely to match the evidence.</p>

<p>We realize this approach using two key ideas. First, our learning techniques operate not over code but
syntactic abstractions, or sketches, of programs. During synthesis, we infer a posterior distribution over sketches,
then concretize samples from this distribution into type-safe programs using combinatorial techniques. Second,
our statistical model explicitly models the full intent behind a synthesis task as a latent variable. To infer
sketches, we first estimate a posterior distribution on the intent, then use samples from this posterior to generate
a distribution over possible sketches. We show that our model can be implemented effectively using the new
neural architecture of Bayesian encoder-decoders, which can be trained with stochastic gradient descent and
yields a simple inference procedure.</p>

<p>We implement our ideas in a system, called BAYOU , for the synthesis of API-heavy Java methods. We train
BAYOU on a large corpus of Android apps, and find that the trained system can often synthesize complex
methods given just a few API method names or data types as evidence. The experiments also justify the design
choice of using a latent intent variable and the levels of abstraction at which sketches and evidence are defined.</p>

          <td><p>We present a Bayesian framework for learning probabilistic specifications from large, unstructured code corpora, and
a method to use this framework to statically detect anomalous, hence likely buggy, program behavior. The distinctive
insight here is to build a statistical model that correlates all
specifications hidden inside a corpus with the syntax and
observed behavior of programs that implement these specifications. During the analysis of a particular program, this
model is conditioned into a posterior distribution that prioritizes specifications that are relevant to this program. This
allows accurate program analysis even if the corpus is highly
heterogeneous. The problem of finding anomalies is now
framed quantitatively, as a problem of computing a distance
between a “reference distribution” over program behaviors
that our model expects from the program, and the distribution over behaviors that the program actually produces.</p>

<p>We present a concrete embodiment of our framework that
combines a topic model and a neural network model to learn
specifications, and queries the learned models to compute
anomaly scores. We evaluate this implementation on the
task of detecting anomalous usage of Android APIs. Our
encouraging experimental results show that the method can
automatically discover subtle errors in Android applications
in the wild, and has high precision and recall compared to
competing probabilistic approaches.</p>

          <td><p>Word2Vec is a class of neural network models that
as being trained from a large corpus of texts, they can produce for
each unique word a corresponding vector in a continuous space in
which linguistic contexts of words can be observed. In this work,
we study the characteristics of Word2Vec vectors, called API 2 VEC
or API embeddings, for the API elements within the API sequences in source code. Our empirical study shows that the close
proximity of the API 2 VEC vectors for API elements reflects the
similar usage contexts containing the surrounding APIs of those
API elements. Moreover, API 2 VEC can capture several similar
semantic relations between API elements in API usages via vector
offsets. We demonstrate the usefulness of API 2 VEC vectors for
API elements in three applications. First, we build a tool that mines the pairs of API elements that share the same usage relations
among them. The other applications are in the code migration
domain. We develop API 2 API , a tool to automatically learn the
API mappings between Java and C# using a characteristic of the
API 2 VEC vectors for API elements in the two languages: semantic
relations among API elements in their usages are observed in the
two vector spaces for the two languages as similar geometric
arrangements among their API 2 VEC vectors. Our empirical
evaluation shows that API 2 API relatively improves 22.6% and
40.1% top-1 and top-5 accuracy over a state-of-the-art mining
approach for API mappings. Finally, as another application in
code migration, we are able to migrate equivalent API usages
from Java to C# with up to 90.6% recall and 87.2% precision.</p>

          <td>Defect Prediction</td>
          <td><p>Software defect prediction, which predicts defective code regions, can help developers find bugs and prioritize their testing efforts. To build accurate prediction models, previous
studies focus on manually designing features that encode the
characteristics of programs and exploring different machine
learning algorithms. Existing traditional features often fail
to capture the semantic differences of programs, and such a
capability is needed for building accurate prediction models.</p>

<p>To bridge the gap between programs’ semantics and
defect prediction features, this paper proposes to leverage a
powerful representation-learning algorithm, deep learning,
to learn semantic representation of programs automatically
from source code. Specifically, we leverage Deep Belief
Network (DBN) to automatically learn semantic features
from token vectors extracted from programs’ Abstract
Syntax Trees (ASTs).</p>

<p>Our evaluation on ten open source projects shows that
our automatically learned semantic features significantly improve both within-project defect prediction (WPDP) and
cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) compared to traditional features. Our semantic features improve WPDP on
average by 14.7% in precision, 11.5% in recall, and 14.2%
in F1. For CPDP, our semantic features based approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art technique TCA+ with traditional features by 8.9% in F1.</p>

          <td>Clone Detection</td>
          <td><p>Code clone detection is an important problem for software
maintenance and evolution. Many approaches consider either structure or identifiers, but none of the existing detection techniques model both sources of information. These
techniques also depend on generic, handcrafted features to
represent code fragments. We introduce learning-based detection techniques where everything for representing terms
and fragments in source code is mined from the repository.
Our code analysis supports a framework, which relies on
deep learning, for automatically linking patterns mined at
the lexical level with patterns mined at the syntactic level.
We evaluated our novel learning-based approach for code
clone detection with respect to feasibility from the point
of view of software maintainers. We sampled and manually
evaluated 398 file- and 480 method-level pairs across eight
real-world Java systems; 93% of the file- and method-level
samples were evaluated to be true positives. Among the true
positives, we found pairs mapping to all four clone types. We
compared our approach to a traditional structure-oriented
technique and found that our learning-based approach detected clones that were either undetected or suboptimally
reported by the prominent tool Deckard. Our results affirm
that our learning-based approach is suitable for clone detection and a tenable technique for researchers.</p>
